# MANDY DARK MATERIAL :nail_care: :rocket: :ribbon:

[![Mandy CI](https://github.com/angeldollface/mandy-dark-material/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/angeldollface/mandy-dark-material/actions/workflows/main.yml)

***A simple, beautiful, dark-themed, material-themed template site for the Mandy static-site generator. :nail_care: :rocket: :ribbon:***

## ABOUT :books:

Since I recently release v.0.2.0 of Mandy, a static-asite generator, I thought I'd start my blog again and build this blog using ***Mandy*** herself. This is my blog but also a Mandy template site. To find out more, head on over to this [link](https://angeldollface.art/mandys-house).

## FEATURES :test_tube:

- SEO 
- Minimalist modern design.
- Easy to use.
- Multiple customization options.

## USAGE :hammer_and_pick:

To use this template site for your own Mandy-powered site, you need to have Mandy installed. To find out how to do that, head over to [this link](https://angeldollface.art/mandys-house/documentation/installation). Once you have Mandy installed, you can use this template in the following way:

- 1.) Check you have the latest version of Mandy installed:

```bash
mandy -v
```

- 2.) Create a new Mandy-powered site using this template (`mysite` is the directory in which your new Mandy site will be created.):

```bash
mandy -i mysite -w angeldollface/mandy-dark-material
```

- 3.) Change into your site's root directory:

```bash
cd mysite
````

- 4.) Start the development server:

```bash
mandy -s .
```

- 5.) Open a browser window at the address that is output in the terminal session. Pretty rad, huh? :heart_on_fire:
